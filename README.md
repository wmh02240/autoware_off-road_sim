Autoware Off-road Simulator

# Autoware-RoboRacer Off-road Simulator

The Autoware-RoboRacer Off-road Simulator is a multi-vehicle high-fidelity simulation framework for **Autoware** and **RoboRacer** off-road race cars, built on [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://developer.nvidia.com/isaac-sim) with **ROS 2 Humble** integration. This simulator was developed for the **Autoware Off-road** project to facilitate the training and evaluation of autonomous driving algorithms within off-road and racing ODDs. This research is part of an ongoing collaboration between the Autoware Off-road/Racing Working Group and the Autoware Center of Excellence (CoE) at the University of Pennsylvania.

The simulator features a **1/5th-scale RoboRacer-Max** model equipped with a comprehensive sensor suite: **3D LiDAR**, **RGB camera**, **GNSS**, **IMU**, and **odometry**. It includes a high-fidelity **pumptrack_simple** environment, featuring non-planar terrain specifically designed for challenging off-road testing. The framework facilitates **multi-vehicle configurations** via a versatile control interface that detects incoming **Autoware** and **RoboRacer** control message types, while supporting seamless **Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) testing** via CycloneDDS. Additional tools include a **semantic segmentation recorder** for perception training, built-in **keyboard teleoperation** for manual control, and an optimized launch and config system that is easy to use and ensures a perfect balance between simulation fidelity and real-time performance.

## Docker Setup

The container builds [NVIDIA Isaac Sim](https://github.com/isaac-sim/IsaacSim) from source alongside ROS 2 Humble. The first build takes 30–60 minutes.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/autowarefoundation/autoware_off-road_sim
cd autoware_off-road_sim
```



### 2. Build the Docker Image

```bash
./docker/build.sh
```

> **Version pinning:** `docker/Dockerfile` verifies both `ISAAC_SIM_REF` and the full `ISAAC_SIM_COMMIT`. To deliberately select another release, update both build arguments and validate the simulator before committing the change. The dependency lock is recorded in [`third_party/lariad_versions.yaml`](third_party/lariad_versions.yaml).

### LARIAD Terrain Assets

The optional LARIAD terrain generator and its large environment assets are not stored in this repository or copied into the Docker build context. Fetch the audited upstream revision into the ignored `external_assets/` directory:

```bash
./scripts/tools/fetch_lariad_assets.sh
```

This performs a sparse checkout at the pinned LARIAD commit and verifies the resulting revision. These assets are currently approved for **internal evaluation only**, because the upstream MIT license covers the project code but per-asset redistribution terms are incomplete. See [`third_party/LARIAD_ASSET_MANIFEST.md`](third_party/LARIAD_ASSET_MANIFEST.md) before publishing or redistributing a generated scene.

After entering the Isaac Sim 6.0.0 container, generate and validate the non-destructive compatibility layers:

```bash
/root/isaacsim/_build/linux-x86_64/release/python.sh \
  scripts/tools/prepare_lariad_scenes.py
```

The generated `easy.usda`, `medium.usda`, and `hard.usda` files are written to the ignored `external_assets/lariad_offroad_nav/compat/` directory. The script removes the embedded Barakuda and broken `block.usd` payload, rewrites legacy asset paths, supplies `defaultPrim`, metre/Z-up metadata, and verifies that the environment contains no `PhysicsScene`. It never modifies the upstream binary USD files. Re-run validation without regenerating the files with `--check`.



### 3. Launch the Container

```bash
./docker/run.sh
```

This automatically:

- Mounts the repo as `/workspace/autoware_off-road_sim`
- Enables GPU access via `--runtime=nvidia`
- Forwards X11 for the GUI
- Sets the working directory to `/workspace/autoware_off-road_sim`

---



## Running the Simulation

Always use the custom Python interpreter bundled with Isaac Sim — standard `python3` does not have the `omni.*` packages.

To run the RoboRacer-Max on pumptrack_simple environment demo, inside the container:

```bash
/root/isaacsim/_build/linux-x86_64/release/python.sh scripts/launch_sim.py 
/root/isaacsim/_build/linux-x86_64/release/python.sh scripts/launch_sim.py --headless --/persistent/UJITSO/geometry=false --/UJITSO/enabled=false
```

This will run the simulation with the default configuration file: `scripts/configs/pumptrack_simple.yaml`.

To run with a different configuration file, use the `--config` flag:

```bash
/root/isaacsim/_build/linux-x86_64/release/python.sh scripts/launch_sim.py --config <path-to-config>
```

The LARIAD stage-1 single-vehicle smoke-test configurations are:

```bash
/root/isaacsim/_build/linux-x86_64/release/python.sh scripts/launch_lawn_mower_sim.py \
  --config scripts/configs/lariad_easy.yaml
/root/isaacsim/_build/linux-x86_64/release/python.sh scripts/launch_lawn_mower_sim.py \
  --config scripts/configs/lariad_medium.yaml
/root/isaacsim/_build/linux-x86_64/release/python.sh scripts/launch_lawn_mower_sim.py \
  --config scripts/configs/lariad_hard.yaml
```

`launch_lawn_mower_sim.py` is a dedicated launcher copy. Lawn/LARIAD-specific behavior is isolated there; the original `launch_sim.py` and its existing environment startup behavior remain unchanged. Without `--config`, the dedicated launcher defaults to `lariad_easy.yaml`.

> **Note:** Shader compilation takes several minutes on first launch. Isaac Sim can feel unresponsive during this time.

> **Note:** There are two `[Error] [omni.physicsschema.plugin] Joint body relationship points to a non existent prim, joint will not be created.` messages at launch. These errors do not affect the simulation and can be ignored for now.

The launch script will:

1. Load the environment USD asset
2. Spawn all enabled vehicles from config with correct positions/orientations
3. Remap all sensor topics per vehicle (no conflicts in multi-vehicle mode)
4. Start the ROS 2 bridge
5. Inject keyboard control via the ActionGraph



### Headless Mode

Add `--headless` to run the simulator without a display window. This is useful for **Distributed mode and Hardware-in-the-Loop testing**, **CI pipelines**, and **remote/server deployments** where no monitor is attached.

```bash
/root/isaacsim/_build/linux-x86_64/release/python.sh scripts/launch_sim.py \
  --config scripts/configs/pumptrack_simple_config.yaml --headless
```

**Differences from normal mode:**


| Feature              | Normal                             | Headless                      |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Default control mode | `KEYBOARD_CONTROL`                 | `ROS2_CONTROL` (all vehicles) |
| Keyboard control     | Available (hold `1`/`2` to toggle) | Not available                 |


In headless mode all vehicles start directly in **ROS2_CONTROL** — no need to hold `1` or `2` to enable ROS 2 commands. At startup the terminal prints:

```
[Headless] Running without display. Control mode: ROS2_CONTROL for ['Ego_Vehicle']
[Headless] Subscribe to drive commands via /ego/drive (AckermannDriveStamped) or /ego/control (autoware_control_msgs/Control)
```

Publish commands to the vehicle immediately after launch:

```bash
ros2 topic pub --rate 15 /ego/control autoware_control_msgs/msg/Control \
  '{longitudinal: {velocity: 2.0, acceleration: 1.0}, lateral: {steering_tire_angle: 0.5}}'
```

All sensors (`/ego/imu`, `/ego/odom`, `/ego/point_cloud`, `/ego/gnss`, etc.) continue to publish normally.

### Attach a New Terminal to a Running Container

To attach a new terminal to a running container for RViz, ROS 2 commands, etc:

Outside the container at the **autoware_off-road_sim** directory:

```bash
./docker/attach.sh
```

This automatically sources the ROS 2 Humble environment and sets the working directory to `/workspace/autoware_off-road_sim`.

### Launch Isaac Sim Natively with Full UI

When editing USD files, it is preferable to launch Isaac Sim without using the launch file.

Inside the container:

```bash
/root/isaacsim/_build/linux-x86_64/release/isaac-sim.sh
```

### Lawn Terrain Generator (stages 2–3)

Fetch the pinned LARIAD assets first, then launch the editor with the project
extension registered in Isaac Sim's built-in search folder:

```bash
./scripts/tools/fetch_lariad_assets.sh
./scripts/tools/install_lawn_generator.sh
/root/isaacsim/_build/linux-x86_64/release/isaac-sim.sh \
  --ext-folder /workspace/autoware-off-road_sim/extensions \
  --enable lawn.terrain.generator
```

The installer creates only a symlink under Isaac Sim's `release/exts` folder.
This ensures the Full application can resolve the extension during cold-start
dependency solving. Re-running the installer is safe.

Open **Window > Lawn Terrain Generator**. Asset discovery checks every registry
entry and reports unavailable assets; `Switchgrass` and `Container` are disabled
with a warning in the pinned public checkout. Override the external data root with
`--/exts/lawn.terrain.generator/assetRoot=/absolute/path/to/data` when needed.
The window provides an upstream-style scrolling parameter editor. Use **Load
Config** to populate the controls from YAML/JSON, edit terrain, regions, assets,
surface, lighting and truth output interactively, then select **Generate All**.
**Save Config** validates and persists the current controls; generation itself
does not require saving first.

The same generator runs headlessly from YAML and does not require UI clicks:

```bash
/root/isaacsim/_build/linux-x86_64/release/python.sh \
  scripts/tools/generate_lawn_scene.py \
  --config scripts/configs/lawn_generator_stage2.yaml \
  --output /tmp/lawn_generator_stage2.usda
```

Stage 3 adds mower-oriented terrain modes, slope constraints, work/no-mow
regions, region-aware vegetation, business objects and navigation truth. The
UI opens the Offroad-Nav forest-lawn preset by default. It combines a constrained
mower work area with the pinned upstream forest PBR textures, HDRI, mixed trees,
undergrowth and moss rocks. Generate it headlessly
inside the existing container with:

```bash
/root/isaacsim/_build/linux-x86_64/release/python.sh scripts/tools/generate_lawn_scene.py --config scripts/configs/lawn_generator_stage3_offroad.yaml --output assets/environments/lawn_generated/offroad_lawn_01/root.usda
```

The adjacent `truth/` directory contains `elevation.npy`, `slope_deg.npy`, all
six region masks, a ROS-compatible occupancy map, work-area GeoJSON, semantic
labels, the recommended spawn pose and a seed/asset hash manifest. Generated
scene outputs are intentionally ignored by Git and can be reproduced from the
versioned YAML.

Render the same fixed validation camera without opening the UI:

```bash
/root/isaacsim/_build/linux-x86_64/release/python.sh scripts/tools/render_lawn_preview.py --stage assets/environments/lawn_generated/offroad_lawn_01/root.usda --output assets/environments/lawn_generated/offroad_lawn_01/preview.png
```

Use `--cycles 10` for the required generate/clear leak smoke test. Add
`--validate-lifecycle` when performing the full acceptance test that also
constructs the real UI window and exercises extension disable/re-enable. Normal
scene generation skips that relatively expensive lifecycle check and exits as
soon as the USD and truth data have been written. Both modes check fixed-seed
heightfield/object counts and verify that no `PhysicsScene` was authored. Python
dependencies are declared in `extensions/lawn.terrain.generator/requirements.txt`
and installed into Isaac Sim's bundled Python by the Dockerfile.

## Keyboard Control

**Click inside the Isaac Sim viewport** to give it focus after launch.


| Key             | Action                                                                         |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `W` / `↑`       | Accelerate forward                                                             |
| `S` / `↓`       | Accelerate backward                                                            |
| `A` / `←`       | Steer left                                                                     |
| `D` / `→`       | Steer right                                                                    |
| `Space`         | Brake (sets speed and steering command to zero while held)                     |
| `~`             | Switch camera view to Perspective                                              |
| `1`             | Switch camera view to Ego Vehicle                                              |
| `2`             | Switch camera view to Opponent Vehicle                                         |
| Hold `1` (≥1 s) | Toggle Ego Vehicle between **KEYBOARD_CONTROL** and **ROS2_CONTROL** mode      |
| Hold `2` (≥1 s) | Toggle Opponent Vehicle between **KEYBOARD_CONTROL** and **ROS2_CONTROL** mode |
| `Backspace`     | Restart simulation                                                             |
| `/`             | Toggle viewport HUD on/off                                                     |
| `R`             | Toggle segmentation dataset recording on/off                                   |


Each vehicle has an independent control mode toggled by holding `1` / `2` for ≥1 seconds:

- **KEYBOARD_CONTROL** — keyboard drives the vehicle (WASD / arrow keys). ROS 2 commands on the drive/control topics are ignored.
- **ROS2_CONTROL** — the vehicle is driven exclusively by incoming `autoware_control_msgs/Control` or `AckermannDriveStamped` messages. Keyboard input is ignored. If no fresh ROS 2 command is received, the vehicle holds at speed 0.

> **Note:** After starting or restarting the simulation with `Backspace`, the pre-configured LiDAR point cloud topic may stop updating in RViz due to a TF timestamp mismatch (Warning: TF_OLD_DATA). Click the `Reset` button in the bottom-left corner of the RViz window, and the LiDAR point cloud topic will start updating again.

---



## User Interface



### Viewport HUD

Each enabled vehicle has a semi-transparent HUD card in the top-left corner of its viewport showing real-time telemetry:

- **Header line** — vehicle name; blue = currently selected (keyboard focus)
- **CONTROL** — active mode (`KEYBOARD` or `ROS2`)
- **Speed / Steer** — commanded speed (m/s) and steering angle (°)
- **ODOMETRY** — position (X/Y/Z), linear velocity, angular velocity
- **IMU** — linear acceleration, angular acceleration
- **GNSS** — latitude and longitude

Press `/` to toggle all HUD windows on or off.

### Terminal Status

The terminal prints two in-place updating lines (one per vehicle) showing the active control mode, commanded speed, steering angle, and real-time factor:

```
[KBD] Ego_Vehicle: Spd=+2.50 m/s  Str=+15.3°  | RT=98%
[ROS] Opponent_Vehicle: Spd=+3.10 m/s  Str=-4.2°
```



### Split-Screen Mode

When `split_screen: true` is set in the config and both vehicles are enabled, Isaac Sim opens two side-by-side viewports:


| Viewport | Shows            |
| -------- | ---------------- |
| Left     | Ego Vehicle      |
| Right    | Opponent Vehicle |


In split-screen mode:

- **WASD keys** control the vehicle shown in the **left** viewport; **arrow keys** control the **right** viewport.
- Click on the **left** or **right** viewport to give it focus. Press key `1` / `2` to switch vehicle between Ego or Opponent for the selected viewport.
- Keys `1` / `2` can still be held to toggle each vehicle's control mode independently.
- Press `~` returns to the free perspective camera.

---



## ROS 2 Topics



### Topic Remapping

Topics in `topics_to_remap` are rewritten at launch time by prepending each vehicle's `topic_prefix` (e.g. `/imu` → `/ego/imu`). Frame IDs in `frame_ids_to_remap` are rewritten to `<prefix>/<frame>` (e.g. `odom` → `ego/odom`). The USD file does not need to be modified.

```yaml
# Topics baked into the USD that are rewritten with each vehicle's topic_prefix.
topics_to_remap:
  - "/drive"
  - "/imu"
  - "/odom"
  - "/point_cloud"
  - "/rgb"

# TF frame IDs baked into the USD that are rewritten to <prefix>/<frame>.
frame_ids_to_remap:
  - "odom"
  - "base_link"
```



### Drive Command (after remapping)

Each vehicle exposes two separate command topics — one per message type. The vehicle must be in **ROS2_CONTROL mode** (hold `1` or `2` for ≥1 s) to act on either topic.


| Vehicle  | Topic               | Message Type                           | Stack               |
| -------- | ------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Ego      | `/ego/control`      | `autoware_control_msgs/Control`        | Autoware            |
| Ego      | `/ego/drive`        | `ackermann_msgs/AckermannDriveStamped` | RoboRacer / F1TENTH |
| Opponent | `/opponent/control` | `autoware_control_msgs/Control`        | Autoware            |
| Opponent | `/opponent/drive`   | `ackermann_msgs/AckermannDriveStamped` | RoboRacer / F1TENTH |




### Sensor Outputs (after remapping)


| Sensor   | Ego Topic          | Opponent Topic          | Message Type              |
| -------- | ------------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| IMU      | `/ego/imu`         | `/opponent/imu`         | `sensor_msgs/Imu`         |
| Odometry | `/ego/odom`        | `/opponent/odom`        | `nav_msgs/Odometry`       |
| LiDAR    | `/ego/point_cloud` | `/opponent/point_cloud` | `sensor_msgs/PointCloud2` |
| Camera   | `/ego/rgb`         | `/opponent/rgb`         | `sensor_msgs/Image`       |
| GNSS     | `/ego/gnss`        | `/opponent/gnss`        | `sensor_msgs/NavSatFix`   |
| TF       | `/tf`              | `/tf`                   | `tf2_msgs/TFMessage`      |




### Control Mode Status

Each vehicle publishes its active control mode as a `std_msgs/Int32` topic:


| Vehicle  | Topic                    | Value                                          |
| -------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Ego      | `/ego/control_mode`      | `0` = `KEYBOARD_CONTROL`, `1` = `ROS2_CONTROL` |
| Opponent | `/opponent/control_mode` | `0` = `KEYBOARD_CONTROL`, `1` = `ROS2_CONTROL` |


The topic is updated immediately whenever the control mode changes (hold `1` / `2` for ≥1 s), at simulation startup, and after a restart (`Backspace`).

---



## Control Interface

The simulator accepts drive commands from both **Autoware** and **RoboRacer / F1TENTH** stacks. Each stack publishes to its own dedicated topic — no configuration change is needed.

### How it works

At startup, `launch_sim.py` spawns a Python 3.10 subprocess (`isaacsim_drive_bridge`, visible in `ros2 node list`) that registers **two subscriptions per vehicle**:

- `/ego/drive` — `AckermannDriveStamped`: forwarded directly to the vehicle's built-in OmniGraph Ackermann controller.
- `/ego/control` — `autoware_control_msgs/Control`: bridge extracts `longitudinal.velocity` + `lateral.steering_tire_angle` and republishes them as `AckermannDriveStamped` on `/ego/drive`, so the OmniGraph controller receives the command.

**Control mode** is set per-vehicle by holding `1` (Ego) / `2` (Opponent) for ≥1 seconds:

- **KEYBOARD_CONTROL mode** — keyboard input is applied; ROS 2 commands are ignored
- **ROS2_CONTROL mode** — ROS 2 commands are applied; keyboard input is ignored



### Step 1 — Switch vehicle to ROS2_CONTROL mode

Click inside the Isaac Sim viewport, then hold `1` (Ego) or `2` (Opponent) for ≥1 second until the HUD shows `CONTROL:KEYBOARD` -> `CONTROL:ROS2`.

The active control source is shown in the terminal status line:

```
[KBD] Ego_Vehicle: Spd=+0.00 m/s  Str=+0.0°  | RT=88%
[Control] Ego_Vehicle → ROS2_CONTROL
[ROS] Ego_Vehicle: Spd=+0.00 m/s  Str=+0.0°  | RT=89%
```



### Step 2 — Publishing an Autoware or RoboRacer control command

In another terminal inside the container (see **Attach a New Terminal to a Running Container**):

```bash
ros2 topic pub --rate 15 /ego/control autoware_control_msgs/msg/Control \
  '{longitudinal: {velocity: 2.0, acceleration: 1.0}, lateral: {steering_tire_angle: 0.5}}'
```

or

```bash
ros2 topic pub --rate 15 /ego/drive ackermann_msgs/msg/AckermannDriveStamped \
  '{drive: {speed: 2.0, steering_angle: 0.5}}'
```

---



## Multi-Vehicle Setup

Both vehicles can use the **same USD asset** (`roboracer_max.usd`). The launch script handles all topic isolation automatically via `topic_prefix`.

```yaml
vehicles:
  - name: "Ego_Vehicle"
    enabled: true
    asset: "assets/vehicles/roboracer_max.usd"
    topic_prefix: "/ego"
    spawn_position: [0.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    spawn_orientation: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]
    enable_camera: true
    enable_lidar: true
    enable_gnss: true

  - name: "Opponent_Vehicle"
    enabled: false
    asset: "assets/vehicles/roboracer_max.usd"
    topic_prefix: "/opponent"
    spawn_position: [-2.0, 0.0, 0.0]
    spawn_orientation: [0.0, 0.0, -90.0]
    enable_camera: true
    enable_lidar: true
    enable_gnss: true
```

## Distributed Mode and Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Testing

This setup connects a remote **PC** or **Jetson** running the **Autoware** or **RoboRacer** autonomy stack to the Isaac Sim environment running on the **simulation PC** over a **LAN or WiFi** network. This allows the autonomy stack to run on a different machine than the simulation environment, saving the simulation PC's resources for simulation.

> **Note:** WiFi is supported but introduces variable latency. Use a dedicated 5 GHz access point, or prefer wired Ethernet for high-frequency sensor streams (LiDAR, camera).

The stack uses **CycloneDDS** (`RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp`), matching Autoware's default middleware. CycloneDDS auto-discovers peers via multicast — no discovery server is needed.

#### Step 1 — Launch the simulator (no extra config needed)

The default `pumptrack_simple_config.yaml` already has the correct settings:

```yaml
network_setup:
  ros2_domain_id: 0
  network_interface: "auto"   # "auto" = CycloneDDS multicast; set to "eth0" or "192.168.x.x" to pin a NIC
```

Launch as usual. CycloneDDS starts automatically and you will see:

```
[ROS2] RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp  ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0
[ROS2] CycloneDDS using automatic interface/multicast discovery
```

> **Multi-NIC hosts:** If the simulation PC has both Ethernet and WiFi, set `network_interface: "eth0"` (or the relevant interface name / IP) to ensure CycloneDDS binds to the correct adapter.



#### Step 2 — Configure the remote PC or Jetson

CycloneDDS auto-discovers peers on the same subnet using UDP multicast. Just set two environment variables before launching your autonomy stack:

```bash
export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0
export RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp

# Then launch your stack (example):
ros2 launch f1tenth_stack bringup_launch.py
```

Ensure the `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` is the same on both the simulation PC and the remote PC/Jetson. Use different `ROS_DOMAIN_ID`s for different simulation instances.

#### Step 3 — Verify Connectivity

From the remote PC or Jetson:

```bash
ros2 topic list               # Should show /ego/imu, /ego/odom, etc.
ros2 topic hz /ego/point_cloud  # Verify LiDAR data is flowing from PC
ros2 topic echo /ego/drive    # Verify your stack is publishing commands
```

From the simulation PC:

```bash
ros2 topic echo /ego/drive    # Should show the commands sent by the Jetson
```

> **Firewall note:** CycloneDDS uses UDP multicast (239.255.0.1) and unicast. Ensure UDP ports are not blocked: `sudo ufw allow from <remote-ip>` or disable the firewall on the LAN interface.

## Surface Friction

Friction values for each physics material in the environment are configured under `environment.frictions` in the config file. Each entry matches a material by its prim name and sets `dynamic_friction` and `static_friction`:

```yaml
environment:
  asset: "assets/environments/pumptrack_simple.usd"
  frictions:
    - name: "TirePhysicsMaterial"
      dynamic_friction: 1.0
      static_friction: 1.0
    - name: "AsphaltPhysicsMaterial"
      dynamic_friction: 0.7
      static_friction: 0.9
    - name: "GrassPhysicsMaterial"
      dynamic_friction: 0.4
      static_friction: 0.6
```

These values are applied to the stage at startup, overriding whatever is baked into the USD asset. Friction calculations are based on the average of the two contacting materials.

---



## Semantic Segmentation Dataset Recording

The simulator can generate a paired RGB + semantic segmentation dataset while driving, useful for training perception models.

### Semantic Segmentation Image Settings

```yaml
semantic_segmentation:
  id_keywords:
    0: ["default"]      # Catch-all label (non-drivable)
    1: ["track"]        # Drivable surface — matched by prim name keyword
  color_map:
    0: [61, 93, 255]    # non-drivable → blue
    1: [0, 255, 220]    # drivable → cyan
  capture_frequency: 8  # every (120Hz / 8Hz) = 15 frames
  image_resolution: [1280, 720]
  images_dir: "data/segmentation/pumptrack_simple/pumptrack_simple/images"
  gt_masks_dir: "data/segmentation/pumptrack_simple/pumptrack_simple/gt_masks"
  overwrite_existing: false
```



### How it works

- Press `R` in the viewport to **start** recording. Press `R` again to **stop**.
- Each capture saves two files with the same zero-padded filename:
  - `images/000000.png` — RGB image from the ego vehicle's colour camera
  - `gt_masks/000000.png` — Colour-coded semantic segmentation mask
- Capture rate, output paths, label classes, and colours are all set in the config under `semantic_segmentation`.
- Enable `overwrite_existing` to reset the frame counter to 0 and save images from the start.



### Semantic labelling

Environment Mesh prims are labelled by matching their prim name against the `id_keywords` list. The `"default"` keyword acts as the catch-all for any prim that does not match a more specific keyword.

### Output structure

```
data/
└── segmentation/
    └── pumptrack_simple/
        └── pumptrack_simple/
            ├── images/
            │   ├── 000000.png
            │   ├── 000001.png
            │   └── ...
            └── gt_masks/
                ├── 000000.png
                ├── 000001.png
                └── ...
```

> **Note:** The `data/` directory is git-ignored. Images are saved with world-readable permissions (`0o666`) so they are accessible from the host when running inside Docker as root.

## Performance Tuning

The simulator prints a real-time factor (`RT=X%`) in the terminal status line. `RT=100%` means the simulation is keeping up with real-time. Below 100% the simulation is running slower than real-time.

```
[KEYBOARD_CONTROL] ACTIVE: Ego_Vehicle | Spd=+0.00 m/s, Str=+0.0° | RT=97%
```

All tuning knobs are in the `physics_settings` and `graphics_settings` blocks of the config file.

---



### Physics Settings

```yaml
physics_settings:
  time_steps_per_second: 60       # Physics tick rate (Hz)
  solver_position_iterations: 8   # Per-articulation position solve passes
  solver_velocity_iterations: 2   # Per-articulation velocity solve passes
```



#### `time_steps_per_second`

Sets the physics substep rate. Each call to `simulation_app.update()` advances the simulation by `1 / time_steps_per_second` seconds. If the GPU/CPU cannot complete one update within that wall-clock budget, RT% drops below 100%.


| Value                | Effect                                                              |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Higher (e.g. 120 Hz) | More accurate collision/suspension; higher CPU cost, lower RT%      |
| Lower (e.g. 55 Hz)   | Lower CPU cost; good for single-vehicle use, higher RT%             |
| Too low (< 30 Hz)    | Visible physics artifacts (tunnelling, jitter), vehicle breaking up |


**Recommended starting point:** `55`–`60` Hz for a single RC car on a smooth track.

#### `solver_position_iterations`

Controls how many times per tick PhysX refines joint positions, contact penetration, and suspension geometry for each articulated vehicle.


| Value          | Effect                                               |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `16` (default) | Most accurate; highest CPU cost                      |
| `8`            | Good balance for RC cars with simple revolute joints |
| `4`            | Aggressive; stable on smooth terrain at low speed    |
| `< 4`          | Joint drift, wheel clipping, possible explosion      |




#### `solver_velocity_iterations`

Controls how many passes PhysX uses to resolve friction, restitution, and velocity damping.


| Value         | Effect                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `4` (default) | Full accuracy; correct friction response                |
| `2`           | Slightly reduced friction accuracy; cheaper             |
| `1`           | Minimal cost; may show lateral sliding on tight corners |




#### Typical configurations


| Scenario                     | `time_steps_per_second` | `pos_iters` | `vel_iters` |
| ---------------------------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Single vehicle, smooth track | 55–60                   | 8           | 2           |
| Two vehicles                 | 50–55                   | 8           | 2           |
| Maximum fidelity             | 120                     | 16          | 4           |
| Maximum performance          | 40–50                   | 4           | 1           |


> **Note:** `solver_type` is permanently set to `"PGS"` in code. TGS is faster but very unstable in racing scenarios. Vehicle breaks up easily.

### Graphics Settings

```yaml
graphics_settings:
  render_resolution: [2560, 1440]
  enable_DLSS_FPS_Multiplier_x2: false
  disable_shadows: false
  disable_ambient_occlusion: true
  disable_reflections: true
```



#### `render_resolution`

The resolution the RTX renderer produces each frame. Lowering this could improve the GPU performance.


| Resolution     | GPU cost  |
| -------------- | --------- |
| `[3840, 2160]` | Very High |
| `[2560, 1440]` | High      |
| `[1920, 1080]` | Medium    |
| `[1280, 720]`  | Low       |




#### `enable_DLSS_FPS_Multiplier_x2`

Enables NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution (Performance mode combined with DLSS-G 2× frame generation). Requires an RTX 40-series GPU for frame generation. On supported hardware this nearly doubles perceived FPS with minimal visual quality loss. However, it could lower the RT%.

#### `disable_shadows` / `disable_ambient_occlusion`/ `disable_reflections`

Disabling shadows, ambient occlusion, and reflections could help improve the GPU performance.

---



## Troubleshooting



### Vehicle does not move

1. Click inside the Isaac Sim viewport to give it keyboard focus.
2. Check the terminal for `[Teleop] SUCCESS: Control path initialized for Ego_Vehicle`.
3. If missing, the ActionGraph path may have changed — inspect the stage's OmniGraph nodes and update the search string in `launch_sim.py`.



### External ROS 2 drive command has no effect

1. **Switch to ROS2_CONTROL mode first.** Hold `1` (Ego) or `2` (Opponent) for ≥1 second inside the viewport. The terminal status line must show `[ROS2_CONTROL]`, not `[KEYBOARD_CONTROL]`.
2. **Confirm the bridge is running.** After launch, `ros2 node list` must include `/isaacsim_drive_bridge`. If it is missing, check `scripts/drive_bridge.log` for errors.
3. **Check startup logs.** The terminal should print lines like:
  ```
   [drive_bridge] Ego_Vehicle: subscribed '/ego/drive' [AckermannDriveStamped]
   [drive_bridge] Ego_Vehicle: subscribed '/ego/control' [autoware_control_msgs/Control] → republish on '/ego/drive'
  ```
   If `autoware_control_msgs/Control` is missing, the package is not installed — verify `ros-humble-autoware-control-msgs` was installed during the Docker build.
4. **Use the correct topic.** Autoware stacks should publish to `/ego/control` (`autoware_control_msgs/Control`). RoboRacer/F1TENTH stacks publish to `/ego/drive` (`AckermannDriveStamped`).
5. **Check the status line.** Once a live command is received it switches from `[ROS2_CONTROL]` to `[ACKERMANN]` or `[AUTOWARE]`.



### Segmentation images not saving

- Check the terminal for `[Segmentation] Setup complete` after launch. If it shows `seg_enabled=False`, check for setup errors above it.
- Confirm `R` is pressed with the viewport focused.
- Verify the `images_dir` and `gt_masks_dir` paths exist under `data/` — they are created automatically on launch.
- Images saved inside Docker (running as root) will have `0o666` permissions and should be readable from the host.



### ROS 2 topics not visible

- Confirm `ros2_domain_id` matches between Isaac Sim and your terminal (default: `0`).
- If using CycloneDDS (default), ensure `RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp` is set on **both** machines and both are on the **same subnet** with multicast enabled. Look for `[ROS2] RMW_IMPLEMENTATION=rmw_cyclonedds_cpp` in the terminal output to confirm.
- Check that `ROS_DOMAIN_ID` is identical on both machines (default: `0`).



### GNSS topics not appearing

- Confirm `gnss.enabled: true` is set at the top level of the config and `enable_gnss: true` is set on the vehicle.
- Check the terminal for `[GNSS] <vehicle>: NavSatFix publisher on '/ego/gnss'` at launch. If it shows `[GNSS] Setup error:`, check `scripts/gnss_bridge.log` for the full error from the Python 3.10 bridge process.
- The bridge requires `/usr/bin/python3.10` and the ROS Humble packages at `/opt/ros/humble`. Both are present in the Docker image.
- Verify the topic is live: `ros2 topic hz /ego/gnss` (expected ~10 Hz).



### `python.sh: No such file or directory`

The Isaac Sim build output is at:

```
/root/isaacsim/_build/linux-x86_64/release/python.sh
```

If missing, the build may not have completed. Re-run `./docker/build.sh`.
